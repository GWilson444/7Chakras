        <img id="chakra-meditation" src="./resources/images/chakra-meditation.png">
        <p>We know that living things on the planet have physical 
            bodies, but did you know that there also exists an 
            energy body? Our energy system is field of energy that
            exists all around us. It runs through and interacts with 
            our physical body.</p>
        <p>In this field of energy around us, there are swirling vortexes
           called chakras. There are seven main chakras that interact with 
           various physiological and neurological systems in the body. They 
           are called the <a href="#root">Root</a>, <a href="#sacral">Sacral</a>, <a href="#solar-plexus">Solar Plexus</a>, <a href="#heart">Heart</a>, <a href="#throat">Throat</a>, <a href="#brow">Brow</a>,
           and <a href="#crown">Crown</a> chakras.</p>

      <div id="main">
        <h2 id="root" class="chakras">Root Chakra</h2>

        <p>Located at the base of the spine, the pelvic floor, and the first three vertebrae, the root chakra is responsible for your sense of safety and security.</p>
        <p>The root chakra is comprised of whatever grounds you to stability in your life. This includes your basic needs such as food, water, shelter, and safety, as well as your more emotional needs such as letting go of fear. When these needs are met, you feel grounded and safe, and you tend to worry less day to day.</p>
        <h2 id="sacral" class="chakras">Sacral Chakra</h2>

        <p>The second chakra is also known as the creativity and sexual chakra. It is located above the pubic bone and below the navel, and encompasses the genital region.</p>
        <p>A balanced second chakra leads to feelings of wellness, abundance, pleasure, and joy. When this chakra is out of balance, a person may experience emotional instability, fear of change, sexual dysfunction, depression, or addictions</p>
        <h2 id="solar-plexus" class="chakras">Solar Plexus Chakra</h2>
        <figure>
          <img class="chakra-pictures" src="./resources/images/manipura chakra.png" alt="=Picture of solar plexus chakra.">
        </figure>
        <p>Located around the navel in the area of the solar plexus and up to the breastbone, the third chakra is a source of personal power and governs self-esteem, warrior energy, and the power of transformation. It also controls metabolism and digestion.</p>
        <p>When you feel self-confident, have a strong sense of purpose, and are self-motivated, your third chakra is open and healthy. If you're experiencing chakra imbalance, you can suffer from low self-esteem, have difficulty making decisions, and may have anger or control issues.</p>
        <h2 id="heart" class="chakras">Heart Chakra</h2>
        <figure>
          <img  class="chakra-pictures" src="./resources/images/anahata chakra.png" alt="Picture of heart chakra.">
        </figure>
        <p>The fourth chakra, also referred to as the heart chakra, is located at the center of the chest and includes the heart, cardiac plexus, thymus gland, lungs, and breasts. It also rules the lymphatic system. When your heart chakra is open, you are flowing with love and compassion, you are quick to forgive, and you accept others and yourself. A closed heart chakra can give way to grief, anger, jealousy, fear of betrayal, and hatred toward yourself and others.</p>
        <h2 id="throat" class="chakras">Throat Chakra</h2>
        <figure>
          <img class="chakra-pictures" src="./resources/images/vishuddha chakra.png" alt="Picture of throat chakra.">
        </figure>
        <p>In the area of the throat, the fifth chakra governs the anatomical regions of the thyroid, parathyroid, jaw, neck, mouth, tongue, and larynx. To be open and aligned in the fifth chakra is to speak, listen, and express yourself from a higher form of communication.</p>
        <h2 id="brow" class="chakras">Brow (Third Eye) Chakra</h2>
        <figure>
          <img class="chakra-pictures" src="./resources/images/ajna chakra.png" alt="Picture of third eye chakra.">
        </figure>
        <p>The sixth chakra is in the area of the third eye, which is found in the space between the eyebrows. It encompasses the pituitary gland, eyes, head, and lower part of the brain. An invisible yet powerful third eye, this is your center of intuition. A spiritual chakra, the Brow leads you to an inner knowledge that will guide you if you let it. An open sixth chakra can enable clairvoyance, telepathy, lucid dreaming, expanded imagination, and visualization.</p>
        <h2 id="crown" class="chakras">Crown Chakra</h2>
        <figure>
          <img class="chakra-pictures" src="./resources/images/sahaswara chakra.png" alt="Picture of crown chakra.">
        </figure>
        <p>The top chakra of the seven and located at the crown of the head, the Crown chakra is our source of enlightenment and spiritual connection to all that is. It is a connection to our higher selves, to every being on the planet, and ultimately the divine energy that creates everything in the universe. True opening of the Crown means the realization that you are pure awareness. You are pure consciousness, undivided, and all expansive. Like a drop in the ocean, you are a part of that ocean that contains and encompasses every aspect of it.</p>
